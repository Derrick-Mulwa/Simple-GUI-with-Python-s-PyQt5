# Simple GUI in Python using the PyQt5 module
This is a simple GUI application built with Python and PyQt5. The application provides a registration window that takes user's name, email address, country of origin, language, gender, race, and if they are a Kenyan native or not. Once a user fills the prompts and clicks submit, their details are printed out on the green area at the bottom of the GUI.
